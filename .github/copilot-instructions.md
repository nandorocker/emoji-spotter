- always use pnpm instead of npm.
- explain your decisions as little as possible, describe your steps minimally.
- don't start the server after every iteration; assume it's already running.
- use `/gamedesign.md` as a reference for any new functionality
- follow `/todo.md` as your manual to build requested features (only use the parts tied to requested feature, don't implement things that were not requested yet)
