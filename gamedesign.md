# Game Design Document

## Levels System â€“ Game Rules

The game progresses through a series of levels, each introducing new challenges via three variables:

- Number of emojis to spot
- Time allowed
- Active emoji categories

The progression is non-linear to provide moments of relief, spikes in tension, and novelty via new category reveals.

### Level Structure

Each level defines:
- **matches**: how many emojis the player must find
- **time**: how long the player has
- **active categories**: how many emoji groups are in play
- **new category**: which category is introduced (if any)

### Category Reveal Order

Categories are introduced in the following sequence:

1. Smileys  
2. People  
3. Animals & Nature  
4. Food & Drink  
5. Activity  
6. Travel & Places  
7. Objects  
8. Symbols  
9. Flags *(final category due to difficulty)*

## Scoring System

The scoring system rewards speed, accuracy, and difficulty while avoiding harsh point penalties. This system is designed to feel fair, skill-based, and motivating.

### Base Score
- Each correctly spotted emoji: **20 points**

### Speed Bonus
- Find the emoji quickly after prompt is revealed:
  - Within 1 second: **+10 pts**
  - 1â€“3 seconds: **+5 pts**
  - 3â€“5 seconds: **+2 pts**
  - 5+ seconds: **no bonus**

### Accuracy Bonus
- No mistakes (i.e. correct on first try): **+5 pts**
- Mistakes made: **no bonus**

### Category Bonus
Some categories are harder to visually process. Bonus points apply per correct match:

| Category         | Bonus |
|------------------|-------|
| Flags            | +10   |
| Symbols          | +5    |
| All others       | â€“     |

*This mapping can be adjusted via config.*

### Confusable Emoji Bonus
If a match involves an emoji from a "confusable group" (e.g. ðŸ˜” ðŸ˜ž ðŸ˜£), and the player matches it without errors:
- **+10 bonus**

Confusable emoji groups will be predefined.

### Mistake Penalty
- Each incorrect tap: **-5 seconds**
- Optional future rule: higher time loss after repeated mistakes on same target.

*Note: No points are deducted for mistakes.*
