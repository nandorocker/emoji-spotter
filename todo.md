# To-Do's

## "Waves" rules update
- there are "waves". each wave is a timer and you have to match X amount of emojis.
- each wave gets progressively harder. the first wave it's 3 emojis, the second 5, third 8, etc.
- also, we reveal more categories as the waves progress... wave 1 has only smileys. wave 2 adds a category, and so on until all categories are visible.
- Between waves, we get a "3.. 2.. 1..." countdown to take a breath. On that break, it should already inform me what the next wave will require.
- whenever I timeout, it's game over

## Combos
- Rethink this feature

## Hints only after a while
- Make the "hint" appear only after a while

## Overlay system
- If there's already a message, and another one appears, those are overlapping
- Make it so they stack, and the new message "bumps" the previous ones up (so the origin point is always the same)

## Sound Effects
- Add SFX and music
