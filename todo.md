# To-Do's

## Game rules update
- there are "waves". each wave is a timer and you have to match X amount of emojis.
- each wave gets progressively harder. the first wave it's 3 emojis, the second 5, third 8, etc.
- also, we reveal more categories as the waves progress... wave 1 has only smileys. wave 2 adds a category, and so on until all categories are visible.
- Between waves, we get a "3.. 2.. 1..." countdown to take a breath. On that break, it should already inform me what the next wave will require.
- whenever I timeout, it's game over
