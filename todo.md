## Gameplay
### Level System

## To-Do: Implement Level System

### Phase 1: Core Logic
- [ ] Load level config (matches, time, categories).
- [ ] Start timer and match tracking per level.
- [ ] On success, trigger next level.
- [ ] On timeout, trigger Game Over.

### Phase 2: Transition Display
- [ ] Reuse existing countdown UI between levels.
- [ ] Add:
  - Next level match goal
  - New category (if any)

### Phase 3: Category Unlock Logic
- [ ] Unlock categories per config order (Smileys â†’ Flags).
- [ ] Pull active categories dynamically from config.

### Phase 4: Config + Debug
- [ ] Make all level parameters editable via config.
- [ ] Add basic logging/debug info for current level state.

### Optional Polish
- [ ] Show new category icon/name in transition UI.
- [ ] Add hooks for tuning or analytics later.

## To-Do: Implement Scoring System

### Phase 1: Basic Scoring Framework
- [x] Create `useScoreStore` or integrate scoring into existing game state store.
- [x] Add function to award base points on correct emoji match.
- [x] Add persistent `score` state across levels.

### Phase 2: Speed Tracking
- [x] Start timer when target emoji is revealed.
- [x] Capture time delta on correct match.
- [x] Store delta in state for bonus calculation.

### Phase 3: Accuracy Tracking
- [ ] Track number of incorrect taps per emoji prompt.
- [ ] Reset error count at start of each prompt.

### Phase 4: Bonus Calculation
- [ ] Implement bonus logic using speed delta and mistake count.
- [ ] Add category-based bonus mapping (config-driven).
- [ ] Add confusable emoji bonus logic (requires static emoji group config).

### Phase 5: Score Update Logic
- [ ] Combine base + bonus into total for each correct emoji.
- [ ] Update global score accordingly.
- [ ] Log or store breakdown (for debugging/analytics).

### Phase 6: Time Penalty
- [ ] On incorrect tap, subtract time from level timer.
- [ ] Use existing timer mutation (no direct timer manipulation).

### Phase 7: Debug / UI Hook-up
- [ ] Expose live score for HUD.
- [ ] (Optional) Add a debug log or floating breakdown panel for testing.

## UI Improvements

### Hints System
- [ ] Make the target emoji's tab appear only after a few seconds (2s)
- [ ] After 5s, make the emoji background pulsate and glow a little and flash VERY mildly

### Overlay system
- [ ] If there's already a message, and another one appears, those are overlapping
- [ ] Make it so they stack, and the new message "bumps" the previous ones up (so the origin point is always the same)

### Settings
- [x] Replaces the "pause" screen and shortcut
- [x] Create simple popup window, same style as the initial instructions
  - Title: Settings
  - Close button: Top right
- [ ] Add the settings, one at a time:
  - [x] Sound volume: *slider* / mute on/off *toggle*
  - [ ] Accessibility: emoji size (small/medium/large) *choice chip*
    - Small: 6 columns
    - Medium: 5 columns
    - Large: 4 columns
    - Tiles always should be sized so they fill the horizontal space available (with proper margins); vertical size must keep the same (or proportional) padding on all sizes
  - [x] Very small credits at the bottom of window

---

## Sound Effects
- [ ] Add SFX and music

---

## Start Screen
- [ ] Make a proper "start screen"

---

## Practice Mode
- [ ] Create a "Practice Mode"
  - [ ] No Timer
  - [ ] Dropdown to select which categories are enabled/disabled (leftmost category tab)
  - [ ] By default, show only the "Smileys" category
- [ ] Add "Practice Mode" button to start screen

---

# Notes

## Onboarding
- Level progression: maybe it should be more focused on each category first... then you start adding them up. Example:
  - Level 1-2: smileys
  - Level 3-4: people
  - Level 5-8: smileys + people
  etc.
- To avoid confusion, always enable only sequencial ones (1, then 2, then 3, then 1+2+3, etc; never 2+5+8 for example)

## Score updates
- Different bonuses for finishing the level faster
- Add some cool messages ("combo!" "nice one!" etc.) depending on what you do. could tie it to the bonuses.
